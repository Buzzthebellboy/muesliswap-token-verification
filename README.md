# MuesliSwap Token Verification ü™ô‚úî

The official repository to verify your token on [MuesliSwap](https://muesliswap.com/).  
Verification means we checked the token description, tokenomics, and the minting policy of the token.  
Note that this does not imply any legal responsibilities from the team towards verified tokens.  
Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research)! üßê  
Please also read the corresponding section in our [documentation](https://docs.muesliswap.com/cardano/community-tokens/token-verification).

## Fees
On [MuesliSwap](https://muesliswap.com/) it is possible to trade **any** token on Cardano **without** being verified.  
However, verification will give you more visibility and increase the community's trust.  
To account for processing each verification manually and to prevent people from spamming requests, we require a verification fee of **50 ADA**. 

## How can I get verified?
You need to submit a pull request to this repository. If you don't know how to do that, no problem!  
Please continue reading the next sections and follow our [tutorial](#tutorial) at the end.

Your pull request needs to add three things: 

üìÑ A correct JSON token description in the [tokens](tokens) folder  
üñºÔ∏è An image for the token in the [images](images) folder.  
üí∏ A comment, with the transaction id showing you submitted 50 ADA to the [payment address](https://cardanoscan.io/address/01deb0dfa55b77e1d9d5ccc3168fad7fdf471a8b9326f026a1ed43908c495455e8f4d0042e077c25be5f30157249c9c4d57cae732d555ef105)
  
Note that there are specific minimum requirements to get verified, such as:  
  
üåê A website  
üìù A token description   
üìä Tokenomics  
‚úâÔ∏è Contact information (e.g., twitter, email)  

### Important:  
**Please make sure that your policy id is somewhere on your website!**  
**Please indicate which category your token belongs to! (DeFi, Meme, etc.)**  
If you do not know how to implement these requirements, you can get some inspiration by looking at our [MILK token](https://docs.muesliswap.com/cardano/tokenomics/muesliswap-milk) or contact us.  


### JSON token description

The folder `tokens` contains [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files that describe each verified token listed at AdaMuesliSwap.
Each file contains information on what the coin is called, its supply and other important information.
The name of the file is the string `<policy_id>.<name>.json`.

| Field | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| `policyId` | The policy id of the token | `8a1cfae21368b8bebbbed9800fec304e95cce39a2a57dc35e2e3ebaa` |
| `name` | The asset name of the token | `MILK` |
| `symbol` | A trading symbol of the token | `MILK` or `CDOG` |
| `website` | Homepage of the corresponding token | `https://ada.muesliswap.com` |
| `description` | A very short description of the token | `Your favorite pre-sale token, making you stronger` |

### Images

In the folder `images`, an image is listed for each token that should be traded.
This is required so that an image can be displayed for the token on the website.
The name of the file is the string `<policy_id>.<name>.png`.

### Payment

The payment address is [addr1q80tpha9tdm7rkw4enp3drad0l05wx5tjvn0qf4pa4peprzf23273axsqshqwlp9he0nq9tjf8yuf4tu4eej64277yzskzqlf2](https://cardanoscan.io/address/01deb0dfa55b77e1d9d5ccc3168fad7fdf471a8b9326f026a1ed43908c495455e8f4d0042e077c25be5f30157249c9c4d57cae732d555ef105)  
we can only complete the verification once we receive the payment. 
Please include a message with your token name or other identifying information in your transaction. 

### Example  

See [tokens/8f52f6a88acf6127bc4758a16b6047afc4da7887feae121ec217b75a.SNOW.json](tokens/8f52f6a88acf6127bc4758a16b6047afc4da7887feae121ec217b75a.SNOW.json) for an example file.
